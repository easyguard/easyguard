=============================

0.1.1-beta
- Now ships an update script to update easyguard: `./ezg update easyguard`
- Setup script now saves the configuration to the overlay.
- DNS Server
	- Now comes with a DNS server supporting blocking (Blocky).
	- The DNS server is used by default in the DHCP server.
	- DNS can be configured in the web interface or using the CLI.
		- Protection Levels
			- Normal: Medium protection. Blocks ads, tracking, telemetry, phishing, malware, scam, fake and more.
			- High (recommended): Better protection than Normal, might require unblocking sometime, but not as much as Aggressive.
			- Aggressive: For experienced users which value privacy. Might require unblocking from time to time.
		- Extra blocking
			- Thread Intelligence Feeds: Blocks known malicious domains.
			- Badware: Blocks hosters known to host malware.
			- Newly Registered Domains: Blocks domains registered recently.
			- [UNDER CONSTRUCTION, DOESNT WORK YET] EasyGuard Extra: Blocks abusive TLDs, search engine garbage, and more.
- CLI now automatically updates the services config files and reloads them. Using ./ezg update firewall or dns is no longer needed except if you modify the json files manually.
